  ## Description
A fullstack single page applicaiton, built using HTML, CSS and JS on the frontend, while Express.js and MongoDB handle backend routing and memory persistence. Application was developed as a Progressive Web Application, using Webpack for file bundling to boost performance, and Service Workers for PWA native device installation. LocalStorage is used for persistence on the frontend for text editor content, but is retrieving data from IndexedDB. PWA also includes image and file caching (HTML, CSS, JS & Service Workers), as well as offline fallback for further functionality.
